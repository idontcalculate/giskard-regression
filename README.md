# Diamond Price Estimation

This project focuses on a regression task to estimate diamond prices using a diamond dataset. We employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for this purpose. The model and dataset will be uploaded to the Giskard platform to evaluate the quality of the predictions generated by the SVM model.
